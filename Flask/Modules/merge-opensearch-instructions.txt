-1) make a backup
0) have opensearch + opensearch dashboards already set up
1) turn off opensearch + opensearch dashboards instances
2) copy (not cut!) the first folder into the additional host (also rename it from "opensearch-conf-1 to "opensearch-conf"), replacing the existing files with the new ones while leaving other files as is
3) copy the newly obtained folder to the second host, then apply the second folder to the folder in the second host (rename as previous step, 2 instead of 1)
4) extract the opensearch + opensearch dashboards yaml section from the docker compose file and copy it in a new docker compose file in the second host
5) patch the the yamls with the provided yamls (docker-compose -f base.yaml -f patch.yaml config > out.yaml)
6) delete the redundant opensearch dashboards from the second docker-compose file
7) start again opensearch + opensearch dashboards on both instances (only the first host has opensearch dashboard)
