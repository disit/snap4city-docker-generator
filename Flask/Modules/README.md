# Adding a new configuration
1) add name of configuration in database
2) add files for configuration in database
3) set given vm for certain files in database
4) edit the dropdown selector in html to add the new configuration
5) code the js for input selection; selection in the first page is carried over the next one
6) add the required fields in the database for the given configuration
7) code the server side configuration in flask_app.py
8) done

## Why is the html and javascript in the same file?
because it's not much code, and sometimes it needs to be generated by python anyway
